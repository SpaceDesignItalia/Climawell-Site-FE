## Overview

Noticing incredibly high churn, the team at Phobia concluded that they needed to improve their onboarding process.

Previously, users selected their phobias manually, but this led to some users selecting things they weren’t actually afraid of to increase their matches.

To address this, we developed a system that displays a slideshow of common phobias during onboarding. We then use the microphone (with the user's permission) to detect when they have audible reactions. We measure the pitch, volume, and duration of their responses and feed that information into the matching algorithm.

The next phase is a VR version of the onboarding flow where users experience a series of scenarios that help determine their fears. We are currently developing the first scenario, working title: “Facing Heights with Confidence”.
